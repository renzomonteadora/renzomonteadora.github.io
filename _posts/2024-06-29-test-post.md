### STP Foundation

- **Sample STP Election**
	![](https://i.imgur.com/kSz7orP.png)

- **Sample RSTP Election**
	![](https://i.imgur.com/KnnaCVn.png)

- **STP Iteration:**

|    Protocol     | Proprietary | Spanning-Tree Calculation |
| :-------------: | :---------: | :-----------------------: |
|     **STP**     | IEEE 802.1D |         All VLANs         |
|    **PVST+**    |    Cisco    |         Per VLAN          |
|    **RSTP**     | IEEE 802.1W |         All VLANs         |
| **Rapid PVST+** |    Cisco    |         Per VLANs         |
|    **MSTP**     | IEEE 802.1S |       Per Instance        |

#### Bridge ID Structure
- **Bridge ID**
	1. Bridge Priority
		- Bridge Priority
		- Extended System ID (VLAN ID)
	2. MAC Address
	   
![](https://i.imgur.com/zGsuwsR.png)

>[!faq] Note
>**Bridge Priority** = **Bridge Priority (default: 32768 or system priority 4-bits: 1000)** + **Extended System ID (VLAN ID)**

#### STP Key Terminology
>[!tip] Info
>**Root Bridge**
>- a switch that has been elected as a root.
>
>**Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU)**
>- a packet that is used for network switches to process STP.
>
>**BPDU Types:**
>1. Configuration BPDU
>2. Topology Change Notification (TCN) BPDU
>
>**Root Path Cost**
>- a metric used for measuring the path to the root bridge.
>
>**System Priority**
>- a 4-bit value that indicates the hierarchy of switch in the STP topology (default value is 32768).
>- the lowest value is elected as root (value between 0-61440, increments of 4096).
>
>**System ID Extension**
>- a 12-bit value indicates the VLAN that the BPDU correlates to.
>
>**Root Bridge ID**
>- details of the switch that has been elected as a root.
>
>**Local Bridge ID**
>- details of the switch that you are managing currently.
>

#### Root Bridge Election Process
1. Lowest ***Bridge Priority***.
2. Lowest ***MAC Address***.

#### Designated Port Election Process
1. Lowest ***Root Cost***.
2. Lowest ***Neighbor Bridge ID***.
3. Lowest ***Port Priority***
4. Lowest ***Port Number***

>[!faq] Note
>- An interface that is connected to a **designated port**, if it is not a **root port**, will become a **blocking port**.

#### STP Timers

>[!tip] KeyTerms
> **Hello Timer**
>- time interval that BPDU is being advertised (default value is ***2 seconds***).
>
>**Max Age**
>- maximum time that a bridge port saves the BPDU information.
>- **802.1D (STP) = default value is 10 Ã— Hello Timer = 20 seconds
>- **802.1W (RSTP)** = default value is 6 seconds
>
>**Forward Delay**
>- amount of time that a ports stays in a ***listening*** and ***learning*** state (default value is ***15 seconds each state***).
>  
>**STP Convergence Time (Approx.)**
>- around **50 seconds** = 30s (Forward Delay) + 20s (Time that the switch needs to realize the link is up/down)


#### STP Link Costs
![](https://i.imgur.com/43qMNMi.png)


>[!faq] Note
> **Link Cost:**
> - is a numeric value that represents the cost of speed of a link.
>
>**Path Cost:**
>- is the calculation of all of the link costs that leads back to the root bridge and the value that is used to elect root port on a switch.


#### STP Topology Change
>[!example] STP process when topology change
>1. Switch that detects a link status change sends a **Topology Change Notification (TCN)** towards the **Root Bridge**.
>2. **Root Bridge** creates a new **BPDU configuration** with the **Topology Change Flag** set, and floods it to all switches.
>3. Switches that receives a new **BPDU configuration** will put itself in a **Learning** state (15s forwarding timer), and **flushes out MAC addresses** in its MAC Table.

## Multiple Spanning Tree (MST)
`- it is an STP that solves the problem of BPDU advertisement overload on each VLAN STP instances (PVST) on a large enterprise network.`
`- it is seperate STP instances for each VLAN.`

### MST Fundamentals (802.1S)
#### MST Region
`- grouping multiple switch as a single virtual switch (much like similar to BGP autonomous system).`
- **How to group multiple switch on specific MST Region?**
	- The same MST configuration name.
	- The same MST revision number.
	- The same VLAN mapping table.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EHQiZ2N.png)

#### MST Teminologies
![](https://i.imgur.com/GTW1gAL.png)

- **MST Instances (MSTI)**
	`- a group of multiple VLANs to advertise only one BPDU per MST instances rather than per VLAN.`
	`- instance value range 1-15.`

- **Internal Spanning Tree (IST)**
	`- a VLAN that is not not assigned to an MSTI.`
	`- instance value of 0 (default instance value).`

- **Common Spanning Tree (CST)**
	`- a mechanism that is used to advertise instantances on switches from other MST regions.`

- **Common Internal Spanning Tree (CIST)**
	`- collection of ISTs in each of MST regions.`

>[!warning] Note
>Assigning multiple VLANs should be avoided on an IST.

#### Metrics
- **Equal-Cost Multipathing (ECMP)**
	`- if there are multiple path to the destination and have the same metrics, it performs load-balancing to send packets to the destination.`
- **Unequal-Cost Load Balancing**
	`- additional EIGRP feature which allows load-balancing even if multiple paths have unequal metrics to the destination.`
	
### Static Routing
#### Types of Static Routing Configuration
- **Directly attached static route**
	- Source: *network-IP-address*
	- Destination: *interface-address*
- **Recursive static route**
	- Source: *network-IP-address*
	- Destination: *network-IP-address*
- **Fully specified static route**
	- Source: *network-IP-address*
	- Destination: *interface-address* and *network-IP-address*

#### Floating Static Routing
`- a static routing configuration to one destination with multiple paths using different administrative distance.`

### Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)
` a technology that creates multiple virtual routers on a single physical router.`

## First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)
`- it creates a virtual router on multiple routers that will act as a default gateway to the hosts belong to the network.`
`- alongside with its virtual router, it also creates an virtual IP address and virtual MAC address.`
`- it sends a multicast HELLO messages to maintain FHRP to other routers.`

- **3 Redundancy Protocols**
	- Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
	- Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
	- Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)

### Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)
[[Cisco CLI Commands#Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) |HSRP Configuration]]
`- Cisco proprietary.`

#### Virtual MAC Address
![](https://i.imgur.com/us2WYzW.png)

- **Vendor ID** `- dictates the vendor of the device or OUI.`
- **HSRP ID** `- dictates it is HSRP Protocol (07.AC)`.
- **Group ID** `- dictate what hsrp group it belongs. In the figure, the group number is 10 (dec) equivalent to 0A (hex)`.

#### HSRP Timers
- **Hello Timer** 
`- default interval is 3 seconds.`
- **Hold Timer** 
`- default hold timer is 10 seconds (approx 3x of Hello Timer).`
- **Active Timer**
`- used to monitor the state of Active router.`
- **Standby Timer**
`- used to monitor the state of the Standby router.`

#### HSRP Roles
- **Virtual Router**
- **Active Router**
- **Standby Router**
- **Other Routers**

#### HSRP States
- **Initial (INIT)**
- **Learn**
- **Listen**
- **Speak**
- **Standby**
- **Active**
#### HSRP Troubleshooting
- Different HSRP virtual IP addresses configured on the peers.
- Different HSRP groups are configured on the peers.
- Different HSRP versions are configured on the peers or ports blocked.
#### HSRP Multicast Address
- **Version 1**
	- IP Add: 224.0.0.2
	- UDP Port: 1985
- **Version 2**
	- IP Add: 224.0.0.102
	- UDP Port: 1985

### Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
[[Cisco CLI Commands#Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)|VRRP Configuration]]
`- IETF standard.`
#### VRRP MAC Address
- **00-00-5E-00-01-XX**
	`- the XX is the group number of the vrrp.`
#### VRRP Timers
- **Hello Timer**: 
	`- 1 second (defualt timer)`
- **Hold Timer**: 
	`- 3 seconds (default timer)`
#### VRRP Roles
- **Master Router**
- **Backup Router**

### Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)
[[Cisco CLI Commands#Gateway Load Balancing Protocol (GLBP)|GLBP Configuration]]
`- Cisco proprietary.`
`- it works using host-dependent/round-robin/weighted method to assign different mac-to-ip address mapping to the end hosts that are getting an ARP request so that each hosts will forward packets on different routers on the GLBP group.`
#### GLBP MAC Address
- **Many Virtual MAC Address.**
#### GLBP Role
- **Active**
- **Standby**
#### GLBP Parts
- **Active Virtual Gateway (AVG)**
	`- only one (1) router is assigned as an AVG.`
- **Active Virtual Forwarder (AVF)**
	`- the number of AVFs will depend to the number of router associated on the GLBP group. `
#### GLBP Timers
- **Hello Timer** 
`- default interval is 3 seconds.`
- **Hold Timer** 
`- default hold timer is 10 seconds (approx 3x of Hello Timer).`
#### GLBP Load Balancing Methods
- **Host-dependent**
- **Round-robin**
- **Weighted**
